Correlaion vs. Causation
</h1>
<p>
Correlatons are used to see where a set of data can take you by means of association by looking at what is causing the relationship between the two. In other words, these relationships will be strong enough that they will cause a trend bewtween the data. A causation is a weaker assodiation because it looks at the trends of the data that are given to make relationships between data. A causeation looks at what could have caused a set of data to be associated whereas a Correlation looks at the causes for the data and how they relate. the best ways to show relationships are through different graphs. Depending on the set of data, a scatter plot can be used and used to produce trendlines. A pie chart may also be made to show percentages of a set of data. Another visualization for relationships between data can be a histogram that will show your data with respect to time.
